# Donation Campaign - Assignment 8 #
***

## **Important Project Features** ##

- <h2>Donating</h2>
> If you view the details of a card and hit the donate button, a react-toastify toast will appears with a success message. If you click the donate button of an item that have been already donated, a warning message appears to clarify. A maximum of 2 toasts can be shown at a time!

- <h2>Searching</h2>
> The search field takes category names as strings. Pressing enter or hitting the search button will call the handleSearch function which will then filter all the donation cards with the searching category. If the search category doesn't match any categories, no cards will be shown. Instead, a warning message will be shown!

- <h2>Donations</h2>
> The donation page shows all the items those have been donated by the user in a grid. The donated items actually have been saved in the local storage. To clarify, a warning message appears, if there is no items that have been donated yet!
